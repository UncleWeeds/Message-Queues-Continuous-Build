# Message-Queues-Continuous-Build

This Repo includes two tasks 

<b> 1. System Design </b>

InnoDB MySQL Cluster

During the production yesterday, we can see a significant load on the MySQL database. You are assigned to set up an InnoDB MySQL cluster that performs group replication. There should be two secondary nodes and a primary node. For the sake of demonstration, you can use MySQL containers.

<b> 2. DevOps </b>

Continuous Build

Configure a continuous build pipeline that listens to the GitHub repo push, builds the image, and pushes it to the Docker hub. We recommend using Jenkins for this purpose but feel free to do your research.
